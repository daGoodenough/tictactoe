            <h3>Did you want to know about tic-tac-toe? Or about this project?</h3>
            <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well, if you came here looking to know all about this legendary game, you're
                pretty much
                out of luck. Here's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe"
                    class="tictactoewiki">tic-tac-toe wiki</a> if you're curious.</p>
            <h3>All About This Project:</h3>
            <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I figure knowing a bit about how I made this project would be more useful
                information than the history of
                tic-tac-toe.

            <h4>A Little About Me</h4>
            <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So, my name is Damian and I am an aspiring developer with a passion for Bitcoin
                (if you couldn't tell by
                the awesome Bitcoin theme). At the time of making this project, I am 20 years old and just getting
                started on my journey of learning to write code. So far, the learning curve has been challenging, but
                more rewarding than I could have imagined.</p>
            <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I have been jumping around from Codecademy and Khan Academy for the last couple
                of months learning to code. So far, under my tool belt I have HTML, and some basic CSS and Javascript. I
                also am familiar with jQuery. I have been working as hard as
                I can to master these, before I start up at a bootcamp. The time is closing in and I
                can't wait for the bootcamp to start, I am hoping it will take me to the next level.</p>
            <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Read on to know a little about what I implemented to
                build this project and the challenges I had along the way.</p>
            <h4>The Project</h4>
            <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This seemed like it would be a good first real project because it
                would implement Javascript to define the game logic, and also basic css and html to make the game
                visually appealing.</p>
            <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I got to use some jQuery to aid in making the website interactive. I was getting
                confused between
                DOM methods and jQuery methods, so my JS ended up being a mix of the two. Because of that, this will be
                something that I focus more on in the future... being consistent with the way I write my code.</p>
            <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The hardest part of this project was definitely defining the logic for the game.
                I followed along with
                someone building tic-tac-toe using JS a few months ago, so that helped some but they did it completely
                in the console. Also, I could hardly remember what they did. I realized that it was more efficient to
                reason through it myself rather than trying to remember each step that they took. In the end, I think
                that my code may be longer than it has to be, but at least it works. I did a pretty good job about
                keeping all of my functions separate, but I do think that writing more pseudo-code in the beginning will
                help me stay organized.</p>
            <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp All in all, I am really proud of this as my first successful project. I say
                "first successful" because I
                started in on a portfolio site, but then I realized I had no projects to display so didn't have much
                content to work with.
                This project was a great learning experience for me, and I am glad that I took the time to do
                it; I think that I learned more from this than in the last 3 months of doing tutorials and 
                watching videos. My biggest take away from the whole thing was that I just have to keep working and
                trying and eventually it will manifest itself. If I don't write any code, then nothing happens.</p>
            <h4>Where do I go from here?</h4>
            <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As I was closing in on this project, I started to get excited about what my next
                one will be. Right now,
                I am thinking I will start learning React so that I can build more complicated websites (I think thats
                what it's for?). Once I have some knowledge about React I might try building a website for a business,
                or maybe a blog site (if I do that maybe I'll learn more about handlebars.js). Also, I plan to continue
                practicing my Javascript in preparation for attending the <a class="parsity" href="https://parsity.io/">Parsity</a>
                bootcamp next month.</p>
            <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I guess I still have to style this page, then I am done! On to the next!</p>
